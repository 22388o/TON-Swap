# TON-Swap
We are a team of qualified developers, blockchain enthusiasts.

In the real world, the things that bring value, are at the same time valuable for the entire world. That is why we believe that this statement may be true about the world of blockchain, where it often happens that the assets created in one blockchain do not have any value in another.

That’s why we’ve decided to develop a solution that allows to swap assets issued on the basis of different blockchains.

In order to do it, we relied on Atomic Swap/Atomic Peg(Binance style) technologies.

By using this solution, the blockchain world can get the following advantages:

- To establish a decentralized asset flow
- To establish an interoperability between blockchains
- To exchange assets from different blockchains bypassing the intermediaries
- To set an exchange rate between the assets from different blockchains in a decentralized way
- To create value and financial usability between the assets from different blockchains

This may be useful for:
- Dapps/Games - Dapps from various chains will be able to use Gram for their activities and vice versa
- Exchange offices and exchanges - ability to set up a decentralized exchange with Gram
- Blockchain related services - will be able to apply Gram in their activities, for example, Roobee, whose tokens can be exchanged directly into Gram

We intend to continue open-source blockchain development for TON and Ethereum blockchains. In order to provide value to worldwide blockchain community we will consummate our Swap solution, so that the exchange is made in a more efficient way using our code. Of course, we’re looking forward for another use-cases for community driven open-source developent.
Soon we are going to launch one of our collaborations - Roobee will get an access to atomic exchange on Gram powered by Swap.Online
